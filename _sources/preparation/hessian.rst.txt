Hessian
=======

The Hessian can be calculated via a standard frequency calculation. 
There are two ways to generate the VibrationsData object 

1. Created by ASE through a calculation with the ASE Vibrations class using ´´get_vibrations()´´
2. Be read from the calculation's output using one of the parser functions delivered with this module called ´´get_vibrations()´´
